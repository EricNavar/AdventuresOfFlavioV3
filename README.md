# Adventures of Flavio
This is a turn-based RPG made in Unity. I recently restarted development and it's not playable in a meaningful way right now.
In this game you travel to many islands in to free the kingdoms from being ruled over the Wizard Lord. You fight monsters, level up, learn new skills, collect items, and upgrade armor throughout your journey.
